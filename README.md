# snowflake UI

## Preamble

The reason of the existance of this repository is because we needed a way to speed up the website creation on our team.
We used [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/), but we needed some different features, so we forked this repository into a new one.
We have a lot of works to do, migrating all components and adding others.

## Installation

To install Snowflake, use the following command:

````
yarn add snowflakes-ui
````

## Usage

After installing Snowflake, you can import it into your React project and start using its components.

Example usage:

```javascript

import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'snowflakes-ui';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button>Click Here</Button>
  );
}

export default App;
```
